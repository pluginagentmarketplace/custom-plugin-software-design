## Integration Requirements

Each SKILL.md must include:
✅ Clear description in frontmatter
✅ Quick start code example
✅ Core concepts (3-5 major ones)
✅ Implementation examples (3-5 practical)
✅ Best practices (5-10 industry standards)
✅ Common mistakes & solutions
✅ Resources (official docs, books, courses)
✅ Related skills (for linking)

## Cross-Skill Navigation

Skills are organized to support:
- Agent recommendations (which skills for each agent)
- Learning path dependencies (what to learn first)
- Role requirements (skills needed for each role)
- Cross-domain connections (where skills overlap)
