## Typical Use Cases

1. **Platform Selection** - "Should I use React Native, Flutter, or native?"
2. **Architecture Design** - "How do I structure my mobile app?"
3. **Performance Issues** - "Why is my app slow or using too much memory?"
4. **Native Features** - "How do I access device features like camera?"
5. **App Distribution** - "How do I submit to App Store/Play Store?"
6. **Cross-platform Code** - "How do I share code between iOS and Android?"

## Learning Timeline

- **Beginner** (2-3 months) - Language basics, basic app structure
- **Intermediate** (2-4 months) - Architecture, state management, APIs
- **Advanced** (4-6 months) - Performance, native features, publishing
- **Expert** (1+ years) - Complex architectures, mentoring, optimization
